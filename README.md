Source Control and Build Instructions

As the development team for Shoptimize, we must take certain steps to ensure that 
Shoptimize is in a runnable state at all times, and that all team members are up to date on the 
state of the app. Our team works to keep Shoptimize bug-free and smoothly running. Our team 
constantly tests changes to the code, and if an issue arises, they are notified using Git‟s issue 
tracking system. A majority of the work for the app has been done in a group setting as people 
need to get accustomed to using Android Studio and Git and being in a group allows us to help 
each other with problems.

The code for Shoptimize is being shared with all team members via the source control 
tool known as “Git.” At any time, any team member can access the Git repository and see what 
status the repository is in. This includes any recent changes to the repository, any discussions 
on the project, and any reported bugs that have occurred. Using Git, any team member can 
make changes to the code, and these changes will be recorded in Git‟s robust history system.

  a. If you haven‟t already, install git from http://git-scm.com/

3. Building the project
  a. Once you‟ve imported the project, open the Build menu and select „Make project‟.
  b. To run the project on one of Android Studio‟s built in emulators, make sure your 
     computer supports virtualization and that it is enabled from in the BIOS settings

issue tracker and discuss issues already in existence. Collaborators may open, close, edit, and 
assign people to issues. Collaborators also get a notification if a new issue has been opened or 
a pre-existing issue has been closed in the issue system.
